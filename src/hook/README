The hook is under the MIT license

===== How to use this software =====

Make sure you have Ruby installed
Place post-commit and twitter-conf.yaml in your project's .git/hooks/ directory.
Make post-commit executable by running chmod +x post-commit

Surround content you want submitted to Twitter with _* and *_
eg:
        Initial commit _*Working on a cool project!*_

If the message is too long, it will automatically be split into multiple posts.

In addition, multiple messages can be posted by having multiple _* *_ clauses:
        Initial _*First post*_ commit _*Second post*_


Since this is an experiment, the tag #githook is added to any post.
